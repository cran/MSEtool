\title{Ramped harvest control rules (40-10 and 60-20)}
\usage{
HCR40_10(Assessment, reps = 1, ...)

HCR60_20(Assessment, reps = 1, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{Assessment}{An object of class \linkS4class{Assessment} with estimates of
FMSY or UMSY, vulnerable biomass, and spawning biomass depletion in terminal year.}

\item{reps}{The number of stochastic samples of the TAC recommendation.}

\item{...}{Miscellaneous arguments (not currently used).}
}
\value{
An object of class \linkS4class{Rec} with the TAC recommendation.
}
\description{
A output control rule with a ramp that reduces the TAC recommendation
(FMSY * Vulnerable biomass) when spawning biomass depletion (SSB/SSB0) is less than
the target reference point (TRP). The TAC reduction is linearly reduced to 0
when depletion is less than the limit reference point (LRP). For example,
TRP is 0.4 and LRP is 0.1 in the 40-10 control rule.
}
\section{Functions}{
\itemize{
\item \code{HCR40_10}: Common U.S. west coast control rule.

\item \code{HCR60_20}: More conservative than 40-10
}}

\note{
Function will use slot \code{B_B0} of the Asssessment object (e.g. for surplus
production models \link{SP} and \link{SP_SS}) if \code{SSB_SSB0} is unavailable.
