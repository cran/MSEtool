\usage{
HCR_ramp(Assessment, reps = 1, LRP, TRP, RP_type = c("SSB_SSB0",
  "SSB_SSBMSY"), ...)

HCR40_10(Assessment, reps = 1, ...)

HCR60_20(Assessment, reps = 1, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{Assessment}{An object of class \linkS4class{Assessment} with estimates of
FMSY or UMSY, vulnerable biomass, and spawning biomass depletion in terminal year.}

\item{reps}{The number of stochastic samples of the TAC recommendation.}

\item{LRP}{Numeric, the limit reference point.}

\item{TRP}{Numeric, the target reference point.}

\item{RP_type}{The reference point metric for TRP and LRP (\code{"SSB_SSB0"} for spawning depletion by default,
or \code{"SSB_SSBMSY"} for spawning biomass relative to MSY).}

\item{...}{Miscellaneous arguments.}
}
\value{
An object of class \linkS4class{Rec} with the TAC recommendation.
}
\description{
An output control rule with a ramp that reduces the TAC recommendation
(UMSY * Vulnerable biomass) linearly when the relative biomass (i.e.,
spawning depletion or spawning biomass relative to that at MSY) is less than
the target reference point (TRP). The TAC reduction is linearly reduced to 0
when the relative biomass is less than the limit reference point (LRP). For example,
the TRP and LRP for spawning depletion is 0.4 and 0.1, respectively, in the 40-10 control rule.
Class HCR objects are typically used with function \link{make_MP}.
}
\section{Functions}{
\itemize{
\item \code{HCR_ramp}: Generic ramped-HCR function where user specifies LRP, TRP, and relative biomass metric.

\item \code{HCR40_10}: Common U.S. west coast control rule (LRP and TRP of 0.1 and 0.4 spawning depletion, respectively).

\item \code{HCR60_20}: More conservative than 40-10, with LRP and TRP of 0.2 and 0.6 spawning depletion, respectively).
}}

\note{
Function will use slot \code{B_B0} of the Asssessment object (e.g. for surplus
production models \link{SP} and \link{SP_SS}) if \code{SSB_SSB0} is unavailable.
