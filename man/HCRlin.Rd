\title{Generic linear harvest control rule based on biomass}
\usage{
HCRlin(Brel, LRP, TRP)
}
\arguments{
\item{Brel}{Improper fraction: An estimate of biomass (either absolute
or relative, e.g. B/BMSY or B/B0).}

\item{LRP}{Improper fraction: the Limit Reference Point, the biomass
below which the adjustment is zero (no fishing). Same units as \code{Brel}.}

\item{TRP}{Improper fraction: the Target Reference Point, the biomass
above which the adjustment is 1 (no adjustment). Same units as \code{Brel}.}
}
\value{
a TAC or TAE adjustement factor.
}
\description{
A general function that adjusts the TAC by a linear ramp based on estimated biomass.
}
\examples{
#40-10 linear ramp
Brel <- seq(0, 1, length.out = 200)
plot(Brel, HCRlin(Brel, 0.1, 0.4), xlab = "Estimated B/B0", ylab = "TAC adjustement factor",
main = "A 40-10 harvest control rule", type = 'l', col = 'blue')
abline(v = c(0.1,0.4), col = 'red', lty = 2)
