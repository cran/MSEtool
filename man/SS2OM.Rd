\title{Reads MLE estimates from Stock Synthesis file structure into an operating model using package r4ss.}
\usage{
SS2OM(SSdir, nsim = 48, proyears = 50, reps = 1, maxF = 3, seed = 1,
  Obs = DLMtool::Generic_Obs, Imp = DLMtool::Perfect_Imp, Name = NULL,
  Source = "No source provided", Author = "No author provided", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{SSdir}{A folder with Stock Synthesis input and output files in it}

\item{nsim}{The number of simulations to take for parameters with uncertainty (for OM@cpars custom parameters).}

\item{proyears}{The number of projection years for MSE}

\item{reps}{The number of stochastic replicates within each simulation in the operating model.}

\item{maxF}{The maximum allowable F in the operating model.}

\item{seed}{The random seed for the operating model.}

\item{Obs}{The observation model (class Obs).}

\item{Imp}{The implementation model (class Imp).}

\item{Name}{The name of the operating model}

\item{Source}{Reference to assessment documentation e.g. a url}

\item{Author}{Who did the assessment}

\item{...}{Arguments to pass to \link[r4ss]{SS_output}.}
}
\value{
An object of class OM.

\description{
A function that uses the file location of a fitted SS3 model including input files to population the
various slots of an operating model with MLE parameter estimates. The function mainly populates the Stock and Fleet portions
of the operating model; the user still needs to parameterize most of the observation and implementation portions of the operating model.
}
\details{
Currently, the function uses values from the terminal year of the assessment for most life history parameters (growth, maturity, M, etc).
Steepness values for the operating model are obtained by bootstrapping from spawning biomass and recruitment estimates in the assessment.
}
\note{
Currently supports the latest version of r4ss on CRAN (v.1.24). Function may be incompatible with newer versions of r4ss on Github.
