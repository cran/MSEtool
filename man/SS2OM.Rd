\item{import_mov}{Logical, whether to import movement matrix from the assessment.}

\item{Name}{The name of the operating model}

\value{
An object of class OM.

\description{
A function that uses the file location of a fitted SS3 model including input files to population the
various slots of an operating model with MLE parameter estimates. The function mainly populates the Stock and Fleet portions
of the operating model; the user still needs to parameterize most of the observation and implementation portions of the operating model.
}
\details{
The function generally uses values from the terminal year of the assessment for most life history parameters (maturity, M, etc). This function
does detect time-varying growth in the assessment and uses annual length/weight-at-age for historical years.
Selectivity is derived from the F-at-age matrix.
}
\note{
Currently supports versions of r4ss on CRAN (v.1.24) and Github (v.1.34-35). Function may be incompatible with other versions of r4ss.
