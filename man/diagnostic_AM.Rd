\title{diagnostic_AM (diagnostic of Assessments in MSE): Did Assess models converge during MSE?}
\usage{
diagnostic_AM(MSE = NULL, DLMenv = DLMtool::DLMenv, MP = NULL,
  gradient_threshold = 0.1, figure = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{MSE}{An object of class MSE created by \code{\link[DLMtool]{runMSE}}. If no MSE object
is available, use argument \code{MP} instead.}

\item{DLMenv}{The name of the environment that contains the Assessment output
generated during the MSE.}

\item{MP}{A character vector of MPs with assessment models.}

\item{gradient_threshold}{The value of the maximum gradient magnitude below which the
model is considered to have converged.}

\item{figure}{Logical, whether a figure will be drawn.}
}
\value{
A matrix with diagnostic information for the assesssment-based MPs. If \code{figure = TRUE},
a set of figures: traffic light (red/green) plots indicating whether model converged,
according to \code{convergence} code in list returned by \code{\link[stats]{nlminb}}
the Hessian matrix is positive-definite, according to \code{pdHess} in
list returned by \code{\link[TMB]{sdreport}}, and the maximum gradient magnitude is
below \code{gradient_threshold}. Also includes model runtime, number of optimization iterations, and
number of function evaluations of the assessment model during each application of the management procedure.
}
\description{
Diagnostic check for convergence of Assess models during MSE.
Assess models write output to the DLMenv environment if the MP was created with \link{make_MP}
with argument \code{diagnostic = TRUE}. This function summarizes and plots the diagnostic information.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
DD_MSY <- makeMP(DD_TMB, HCR_MSY, diagnostic = "min")
show(DD_MSY)
myMSE <- runMSE(DLMtool::testOM, MPs = "DD_MSY")
diagnostic_AM(myMSE)

# If MSE object is not available (e.g. runMSE crashed), use MP argument instead.
diagnostic_AM(MP = "DD_MSY")

ls(DLMtool::DLMenv) # Assessment output and diagnostics are located here

# Save to disk for future use. File may be very large due to size of DLMenv!
save(myMSE, DLMenv, file = "DLMenv.RData")
